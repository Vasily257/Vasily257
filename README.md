### Hi there, I'am Vasya! ðŸ‘‹

:pencil2: I'm currently studying at Ya.Practicum for a web developer.  
  
:family: Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a project that is really useful to people.  
  
:question: Ask me about separate waste collection and run before I start answering.  
  
:ear: Fun fact: I can move my ears, but I do not know how to use it in programming.
